This is our slides for Zer0con 2024


Modern desktop applications have become increasingly secure due to various mitigations, but Chrome and Adobe PDF reader are still the popular targets for top attackers.

Of course, sandbox escape is the primary challenge here and in this talk, we will discuss our journey of research on sandbox escape including the sandbox internals on Microsoft Windows and our sandbox escape methodology. We will also do a review on the attack surface of different sandboxes on Windows and we will of course show our exploits for escaping the Chrome and Adobe sandbox on Windows.
