# Security Risks in Zero Knowledge Proof Cryptocurrencies - PacSec 2019



This is my slides for PacSec 2019


Zero-Knowledge Proof technology is currently widely applied in blockchain projects, including Ethereum, Monero, Zcash, and more. However, the security and privacy risks in its practical applications are not well-known to the general public. This topic primarily aims to introduce some security and privacy issues in the application of Zero-Knowledge Proof technology within blockchain, through the analysis of security incidents and vulnerabilities in projects like Monero and Zcash. Additionally, we will share the vulnerabilities and risks we have discovered in the specific implementations of Zero-Knowledge Proofs.


零知识证明技术目前被广泛应用于包括以太坊、门罗币、Zcash等多个区块链项目中。但其在实际应用中的安全和隐私隐患并不被大众所熟知。本议题主要通过对门罗币、Zcash上一些安全事件和漏洞的分析，和分享我们发现的一些零知识证明具体实现中的漏洞和隐患，来介绍零知识证明技术在区块链应用中存在的一些安全和隐私问题。
