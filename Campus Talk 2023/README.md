This is my slides for Compus Talk in 2023.

网络空间安全攻防趋势分享： 高级持续威胁（APT）与大语言模型（GPT）


近年来，大规模针对性网络行动大幅增加，攻击复杂性持续上升，网络安全已成为国家安全的重要因素。围绕着网络空间的攻防对抗一直持续在升级。
本议题将回顾过去几十年网络空间安全对抗的发展，从1980年代，第一个PC病毒，到2023年国家级高级持续威胁（APT）攻击。从基于签名的病毒防御技术，到基于AI大模型的Security Copliot。
本议题讲介绍网络空间安全攻防对抗的重要发展趋势的，并简单聊聊对APT与GPT的对抗的看法。


Trends of Cybersecurity: APT vs GPT 						



In recent years, targeted cyber operations have increased significantly, the complexity of attacks continues to rise, and network security has become an important factor in national security. The offensive and defensive confrontations surrounding cyberspace have continued to escalate. This topic will review the development of cyberspace security in the past few decades, from the first PC virus in the 1980s to national-level Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks in 2023. From signature-based virus defense technology to Security Copliot based on LLM. This topic will introduce the important development trends of in both offensive and defensive cybersecurity , and sharing my views on APT and GPT.
